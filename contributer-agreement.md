# Agreement
By adding my name to the list below or responding over e-mail, text, or social media message that I agree to the contributer agreement, I agree
- To follow the [contributor code of conduct](https://github.com/beattyml1/metatonic/blob/master/CodeOfConduct.md), failure to do so could result in being banned from the repo and any related communities
- Assign copyright to the repo owner with the condition that the repo owner release said code under the MIT license
  - This assignment is to simplify if a the code needs to be licensed under multiple OSS licenses or there is good reason to change open source licenses for a later version for unforseen reasons
  - The only piece of code that would ever be considered for closed sourcing is the app builder web app in order to help support continued development
